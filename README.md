hey


not sure what to say about me but uh..
I am very familiar with Python and some of it's libraries, Lua's synthax, just a bit of C++ and JavaScript.
I plan on getting better at all of those and maybe learning some C# and Java (Only because for some reason many jobs require you to know Java)?


if you're checking out my profile well, I guess thank you, I was not expecting it really
